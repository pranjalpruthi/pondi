# Project Brief: ISKM Temple Website Enhancement

## Core Goal

Integrate Supabase (self-hosted instance) into the existing TanStack (Query, Router) application for the ISKM Pudhuvai Temple website.

## Key Objectives

1.  **Backend & CMS:** Utilize Supabase's database as the primary backend and Content Management System (CMS) for website content, including a blog.
2.  **Realtime Features:** Leverage Supabase Realtime capabilities for features like live status updates (e.g., lectures, donation progress) and collaborative elements (e.g., realtime cursors).
3.  **Content Management:** Implement support for Draft Mode and explore possibilities for Visual Editing for easier content updates.
4.  **Blog Section:** Build a fully functional blog section powered by the Supabase CMS.
5.  **Maintain Existing Stack:** Ensure seamless integration with the current TanStack Query and Router setup, using `pnpm` as the package manager.
