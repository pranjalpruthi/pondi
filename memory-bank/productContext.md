# Product Context: ISKM Temple Website

## Purpose

To serve as a comprehensive online platform for the ISKM Pudhuvai Temple, providing information, engagement opportunities, and resources for devotees and the public.

## Problems Solved

-   Provides a central hub for temple information (hours, location, contact).
-   Facilitates online engagement through live lectures, event calendars, and blog content.
-   Enables online donations for various temple projects.
-   Offers an e-commerce platform for temple-related items (books, worship items, jewelry).
-   Keeps the community updated with the latest news and spiritual articles.

## How It Should Work

-   **User Experience:** Intuitive navigation, visually appealing design reflecting the temple's ethos, accessible information.
-   **Content:** Regularly updated content for events, blog, shop, and donation projects.
-   **Realtime:** Live lecture status should update automatically. Donation progress should reflect recent contributions. Collaborative features like cursors should enhance specific interactive sections if applicable.
-   **CMS:** Content (pages, blog posts, product details, event info) should be manageable through a backend system (Supabase), ideally with features like draft previews and potentially visual editing capabilities to simplify updates for non-technical users.

## Target Audience

-   Temple devotees (local and international).
-   General public interested in ISKCON, spirituality, and temple activities.
-   Potential donors and supporters.
-   Visitors planning a temple tour.
